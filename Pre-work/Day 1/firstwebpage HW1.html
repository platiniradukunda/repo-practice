	<h2>Welcome to my profile</h2>
	<h3 id="briefintroduction">A brief Introduction</h3>
	<p id="p1">My name is Platin Iradukunda, I am 23 years old. I was born and raised in Rwanda until 16 years old when I moved to the United States. I graduated from The University of Oklahoma in the petroleum engineering program in May 2020. I am excited to learn about software engineering.</p>

	<h3 id="professionalbackground">Professional Background</h3>
	<p id="p2">Following my high school graduation at Washington Academy, I attended The University of Oklahoma. I graduated in May 2020 with a B.S. in Petroleum Engineering. During my time at The University of Oklahoma, I had the opportunity to work in the oil & gas industry. I did two internships in the industry; one as an oil & gas analyst intern and the other as a drilling engineering intern. Additionally, I did research with one of my professors where we tested a prototype two-phase centrifugal downhole separator. Unfortunately, the oil & gas industry was majorly affected by the pandemic but it  is slowly recovering. I hope to use the acquired knowledge in this program to leverage my petroleum engineering upon graduation.</p>
